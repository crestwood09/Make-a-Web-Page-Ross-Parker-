          Ross Parker has been in the music business touring and recording for two decades. His first step into music came in 1997 when
          his two best friends in high school asked him to play bass in their band. Later he became a founding member of the Widespread
          Panic tribute band, Farmer's Soul. That led to his membership in the rock group, The Ward. Since 1997,
          Ross has played in over 10 bands. He currently plays with The Sam Holt Band, Will Stewart, and The Franklin Tully Band.
